# Migration from UI Patterns 1

## Ecosystem consolidation

If you are coming from UI Patterns 1.x, you may not find UI Patterns 2.x version of your favourite modules on https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module

Maybe because it was merged into an UI Patterns 2.x sub-module:

![](images/ecosystem.webp)

So, you can now found most of the UI Patterns integration inside the main `ui_patterns` project and 2 sub-modules were moved out of the project:

- Display Suite. Now found in https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_ds
- Field Group. Now found in https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_field_group

## Migration steps

To migrate to UI Patterns 2.x, you need to:

1. Update your codebase
1. Update your configuration

To update your codebase, see the [Automatic components migration section](#automatic-components-migration) or do manual updates.

To update your configuration, UI Patterns 2.x provides update hooks. But the codebase needs to be updated first!

### Update workflow

On your local development environment:

1. Update your composer.json to use UI Patterns 2.x codebase (same for related contrib modules).
1. Update your codebase: you may need to delete some configuration to be able to execute Drush commands.
1. Update your configuration `drush updatedb` (restore a database dump if you had to delete configuration to update your codebase), the updates will:
    1. Enable `ui_patterns_legacy`, `ui_patterns_blocks` modules
    1. Loop on `core.entity_view_display.*` config and config with dependencies on UI Patterns modules to update the configuration
    1. Uninstall legacy modules which features had been merged into UI Patterns 2.x.
    1. Loop on content entities with Layout Builder overrides to convert sections using patterns derived layout plugins into components derived layout plugins.

You can then deploy like any standard update.

Note about Layout Builder: you may need to apply a patch on Core to avoid fatal error when Layout Builder tries to instantiate a missing layout plugin.

```JSON
{
  "patches": {
    "drupal/core": {
      "1 - Layout builder cannot recover on missing layout - https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3204271#comment-16145796": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2025-06-13/drupal-3204271-40.patch"
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic components migration

You need to activate `ui_patterns_legacy` sub-module.

And run:

```bash
drush ui-patterns:migrate my_theme
```

Or:

```bash
drush upm my_theme
```

The converted components can be found in `components/`. `patterns/` folder is kept by the migration, but can be removed.

### Component definitions

It is done automatically by the drush command:

- "fields" are becoming slots
- "settings" are becoming props

| UIP 1.x setting type | UIP2 2.x prop type |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Attributes           | attributes         |
| Boolean              | boolean            |
| Checkboxes           | list               |
| Links                | links              |
| Machine Name         | identifier         |
| Number               | number             |
| Radios               | enum               |
| Select               | enum               |
| Textfield            | string             |
| Token                | string             |
| Url                  | url                |

⚠️ Some features, mixing data structure and data sources, don't make sense with SDC and are ignored during migration:

- `allow_variant_token` (on component level) and `allow_token` (on setting level): Replaced by the Token source plugin used with the Variant or any other prop type.
- `allow_variant_expose` (on component level) and `allow_variant_expose` (on setting level): Replaced by the `ui_patterns_source` field type (expected for UI Patterns 2.1). You can attach a ui_patterns_source field and select the variant or any other property in the field widget and display this field inside your entity form.
- `expose_as_field` (on setting level): Also replaced by the `ui_patterns_source` field type. Mapping a property to a specific field is removed.

Anyway, there are a few tasks you may want to do after that:

#### identifier props

In UI Patterns 1.x, `machine_name` setting type was overlooked because:

- it was added late (mid 2023)
- it was not compatible with the broadly used `token` source

In UI Patterns 2.x, it was replaced by `identifier` prop type can be used without those limitations.

#### number props

In UI Patterns 1.x, `number` setting type doesn't allow to tell when a number is a decimal or an integer.

In UI Patterns 2.x, you can replace `type: number` by `type: integer`.

#### Ignored setting types

Those settings are not migrated:

- ColorWidget
- ColorisWidget
- GroupType
- LanguageCheckboxes
- LanguageAccess
- MediaLibrary
- Publish

### Templates

The templates are exactly the same between UI Patterns 1.x and UI Patterns 2.x, except `pattern()` function which has been replaced by the Twig native `include()` function:

```twig
pattern(
  "card",
  {slot_1: foo, slot_2: bar, prop_1: baz, prop_2: true},
  variant_id
)
```

becomes:

```twig
include(
  "bootstrap:card",
  {slot_1: foo, slot_2: bar, prop_1: baz, prop_2: true, variant: variant_id},
  with_context = false
)
```

Differences:

- `component_id` is now prefixed by the provider (theme or module)
- `variant` is now a prop instead of a function parameter
- `with_context = false` must be added to avoid scope leaks.

Until the manual conversion is done, you can still use `pattern()` thanks to a compatibility layer, if you keep `ui_patterns_legacy` activated.

> ⚠️ variants templates (ex: `pattern-card--variant-horizontal.html.twig`) are not kept because they don't exist in UI Patterns 2

### Preview/Stories

A story called `preview` is automatically created from all the `preview` values extracted from the component definition.

For example, this UI Patterns 1.x definition:

```yaml
button:
  label: "Button"
  settings:
    disabled:
      type: "boolean"
      label: "Disabled?"
      preview: false
      allow_token: true
    label_visually_hidden:
      type: "boolean"
      label: "Hide button label?"
      preview: false
    url:
      type: "url"
      label: "URL"
      preview: "https://example.com"
  fields:
    label:
      type: "text"
      label: "Label"
      preview: "Submit"
```

Is becoming this story:

```yaml
name: Preview
slots:
  label: Submit
props:
  disabled: false
  label_visually_hidden: false
  url: "https://example.com"
```

### Preview templates

Preview templates (`pattern-{component_id}--preview.html.twig`) are replaced by `library_wrapper` properties of story definition, but this is not done automatically.

## Compatibility layer at runtime

By keeping `ui_patterns_legacy` activated after the migration, you can leverage a compatibility layer between UI Patterns 1.x and SDC API.

### Render elements

For example, this render element:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'pattern',
  '#id' => 'blockquote',
  '#variant' => 'highlighted',
  '#fields' => [
    'quote' => 'You must do the things you think you cannot do.',
    'attribution' => 'Eleanor Roosevelt',
   ],
  '#settings' => [
     'url' => 'https://example.org'
  ]
]
```

And this one:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'pattern',
  '#id' => 'blockquote',
  '#variant' => 'highlighted',
  'quote' => 'You must do the things you think you cannot do.',
  'attribution' => 'Eleanor Roosevelt',
   'url' => 'https://example.org'
]
```

Are both converted to:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'component',
  '#component' => 'provider:blockquote',
  '#slots' => [
    'quote' => 'You must do the things you think you cannot do.',
    'attribution' => 'Eleanor Roosevelt',
   ],
  '#props' => [
     'url' => 'https://example.org',
     'variant' => 'highlighted'
  ]
]
```

It works also for `pattern_preview` render element:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'pattern_preview',
  '#id' => 'blockquote',
  '#variant' => 'highlighted',
]
```

Is converted at runtime to:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'component',
  '#component' => 'provider:blockquote',
  '#story' => 'preview',
  '#props' => [
     'variant' => 'highlighted'
  ]
]
```

### Twig functions

At runtime, `pattern()` twig function:

```twig
pattern(
  "card",
  {slot_1: foo, slot_2: bar, prop_1: baz, prop_2: true},
  variant_id
)
```

is processed as:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'component',
  '#component' => 'bootstrap:card',
  '#slots' => [
    'slot_1' => foo,
    'slot_2' => bar,
   ],
  '#props' => [
     'prop_1' => 'baz',
     'prop_2' => true,
     'variant' => 'variant_id'
  ]
]
```

> ⚠️ The provider is guessed. If you have many components with the same ID (so, in this example, many cards), the provider may be guessed wrong.

Same for `pattern_preview`:

```twig
{{ pattern_preview('modal', 'highlighted') }}
```

is processed as:

```php
[
  '#type' => 'component',
  '#component' => 'provider:modal',
  '#story' => 'preview',
  '#props' => [
     'variant' => 'variant_id'
  ]
]
```
